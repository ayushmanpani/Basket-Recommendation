# Basket Recommendation System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a basket recommendation system using the Apriori and Eclat algorithms. The system analyzes a dataset to recommend items that are frequently bought together, helping businesses optimize their sales strategies.

## Project Overview

The project includes a single Jupyter Notebook that implements two popular algorithms for market basket analysis:
1. **Apriori Algorithm**: This algorithm identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on the specified support and confidence thresholds.
2. **Eclat Algorithm**: An alternative method that uses a depth-first search to find frequent itemsets, typically more efficient for larger datasets.

The notebook provides insights into which items are most likely to be purchased after a specific item, allowing businesses to make data-driven recommendations.

## Files Included

### Jupyter Notebook
- **`Basket_Recommendation.ipynb`**: Implementation of the basket recommendation system using Apriori and Eclat algorithms.

### Dataset
- **`Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation algorithms, containing transaction records.

## Setup and Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Apyori (for Apriori and Eclat implementations)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy apyori
